### Hi there 👋, I am Tijani Olamide,
-🌳 After concluding my Analytics program at Techway consult I have been challenging myself with a lot of projects to challenge myself and grow my Data Analytics skills.  

-🤗 I am open to Entry-level Data analytics role as I am currently in search of a Data Analyst role.

-👨‍💻 I have worked with a variety of datasets showcasing my skills using EXCEL, SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI.

-🛩 When I am not at my computer analyzing data, I read books and watch lots of movies. What is your favorite movie or book?

-🔗 I am looking to collaborate with any company, organization and even individuals to solve their business problems by leveraging data.
